## Terpmap

Terpmap is a bucket-list-based guide and introduction to UMD’s Campus. It was developed with the goal of introducing new students to UMD’s campus and the “Must-Do” activities in the area. The list of activities is based on and branches off from the bucket list in the University of Maryland ‘M-Book’ published by the UMD Alumni Association. Terpmap assists users in locating, tracking, and describing these activities via a Mapkit-oriented user interface. This bucket list activity tracker for University of Maryland students allows the user to check on-campus items off of the UMD bucket list and sends the user notifications when their device is close to a bucket list activity.

* Map app relevant to the University of Maryland Campus - Provides a pleasant user interface and navigation experience to support a users’ geolocation of points of interest around campus.
* Bucket-list tracker of on-campus activities - Allows users to easily track completion of the activities.
* Location proximity-based notifications - Utilizes the notification system to prompt the user to check an item off their bucket list and lets the user know what activity they are near.

## App Features

### Campus tab
* On initial startup, the user is greeted with the "Campus" view:
* <img width="255" alt="image" src="https://github.com/anshvnm/Terpmap/assets/96885648/fbf2561d-e08f-4792-985c-f3bbd09a15b8">
* At this screen, the user can quickly locate their position relative to the nearby bucket list items.
* Completion can be tracked using the legend provided at the top.
* Details of each activity can be found on the “Bucket List” view. Each icon is unique so that the user can quickly differentiate between the various locations indicated on the map and their associated bucket list activities.

### Bucket List tab
* The bucket list view reflects the current status of the task for the user (completed or not completed):
* <img width="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/anshvnm/Terpmap/assets/96885648/c1ff075b-27ba-4d07-9a5f-12292b433ed9">
* It provides a description of the activity as well as an additional legend at the top of the view.
* The icons that serve as check marks match the map annotations for the same bucket list activities as well as the correct color corresponding to whether or not the bucket list activity is marked as completed.

### About tab
* The about screen provides the users with information about the application:
* <img width="290" alt="image" src="https://github.com/anshvnm/Terpmap/assets/96885648/cf285e51-0eb9-4a17-85cc-b6a203e49d01">
*  Future updates could add version numbers, related products, and developer contact information on this view.

### Notifications
* Terpmap offers live tracking of the user while Terpmap is open and permissions are granted:
* <img width="318" alt="image" src="https://github.com/anshvnm/Terpmap/assets/96885648/eef64f3c-854d-4ae3-bb83-0faf99d18ca9">
* The app can provide the user with notifications of when they are near a bucket list item.
* These notifications are triggered within a geo-fenced area of each bucket list item, and the user will be
notified as they enter each of these areas.
* The triggering of a notification also causes a badge to appear on the app’s icon in the home screen. Both the alert banner and the badge will disappear when the user opens the app.

## Future directions 

There are many directions Terpmap could go to expand its functionality in ways that would
benefit University of Maryland students. It could expand to include dynamic bucket-list updates
that could come from a variety of sources including submissions by users. There could be a
feature where users add their own activities to the bucket-list, which would present an
interesting challenge in how to assign the locations on the map in real time. Other ideas include
allowing users to add annotations to activities like a rating system, make notes about plans to
complete an activity, and attach photos commemorating completion of bucket-list activities.
The app could incorporate a social-media aspect by providing functionality for users to interact
with each other through leaving comments on others’ profiles, seeing the status of completion of
friends’ bucket-list items, and coordinate completing tasks together, such as attending a
basketball or football game. There are also a large number of clubs on campus, so tapping into
the events and recruiting efforts could further expand the reach of Terpmap.
