## Terpmap

Terpmap is a bucket-list based guide and introduction to UMD’s Campus. It was developed with the goal of introducing new students to UMD’s campus and the “Must-Do” activities in the area. The list of activities is based on and branches off from the bucket list in the University of Maryland ‘M-Book’ published by the UMD Alumni Association. Terpmap assists users in locating, tracking, and describing these activities via Mapkit-oriented user interface. This bucket list activity tracker for University of Maryland students allows the user to check on-campus items off of the UMD bucket list and sends the user notifications when their device is close to a bucket list activity.
