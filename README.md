## Terpmap

Terpmap is a bucket-list based guide and introduction to UMD’s Campus. It was developed with the goal of introducing new students to UMD’s campus and the “Must-Do” activities in the area. The list of activities is based on and branches off from the bucket list in the University of Maryland ‘M-Book’ published by the UMD Alumni Association. Terpmap assists users in locating, tracking, and describing these activities via Mapkit-oriented user interface. This bucket list activity tracker for University of Maryland students allows the user to check on-campus items off of the UMD bucket list and sends the user notifications when their device is close to a bucket list activity.

## Goals

* Create a map app relevant to the University of Maryland Campus - 
The first main goal we set out for our application to achieve was to provide a pleasant user interface and navigation experience to support a users’ geolocation of points of interest around campus. We wanted the map to be centered on the UMD campus and also highlight notable locations on campus. The initial version of the map interface was implemented based on the lectures and lecture slides about using MapKit. It was just a static map that showed the region for the map centered on the UMD campus.
